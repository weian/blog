Summary: Demonstration of mathematical equation rendering using LaTeX in Pelican

# Math Rendering in Pelican

This blog supports beautiful math rendering using LaTeX syntax, powered by the `pelican-render-math` plugin.

## Inline Math

You can include math inline with your text. For example, the famous equation $E = mc^2$ shows the relationship between energy and mass.

Here's another example: The quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ is used to solve quadratic equations.

## Display Math

For larger equations, you can use display mode:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

### More Examples

**Summation:**

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

**Matrix:**

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Calculus:**

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right) = f(x)
$$

**Greek Letters:**

The area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$, where $\pi \approx 3.14159$ and $r$ is the radius.

## Why This Matters

Mathematical notation is essential for:

- Scientific writing
- Technical documentation
- Algorithm explanations
- Data analysis posts
- Physics and engineering content

With LaTeX support, you can write complex mathematical expressions just as easily as regular text!
